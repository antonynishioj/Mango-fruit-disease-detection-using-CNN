# Mango-fruit-disease-detection-using-CNN
programed and trained an cnn model which can detect the disease that the mango fruit is affected with. 
I have used the dataset of most common diseases in mango fruit they are "Alternaria, Anthracnose, Stem end rot and also Healthy fruit dataset"
And also I have used gradio for simple demonstration purpose.

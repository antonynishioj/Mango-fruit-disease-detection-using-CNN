# Mango-fruit-disease-detection-using-CNN
programed and trained an CNN(tensorflow) model with 96% accuracy  which can detect the disease that the mango fruit is affected with. <br />
I have used the dataset of most common diseases in mango fruit they are "Alternaria, Anthracnose, Stem end rot and also Healthy fruit dataset" <br />
And also I have used gradio for simple demonstration purpose. <br />
<br />
## Libraries used:<br />
1.Tensorflow (for performing cnn operations)<br />
2.os (for accessing files)<br />
3.np (for performing mathematical operations)<br />
4.matplotlib, sklearn, pyplot (for visulaization of performance)<br />
5.gradio (for simple ui)


## Preprocessing: <br />
for more accuracy and for better detection I have used various preprocessing techniques like - <br />
1.Rescaling<br />
2.Horizontal and vertical flip <br />
3.Zooming<br />
4.Rotation <br />
